## How does it work?

This Chrome Extension uses the [Coindesk API](https://www.coindesk.com/api/) to get the closing price of 1 Bitcoin (BTC) in USD x years ago from today so that you can feel sorry for yourself.

You can add the extension by downloading from the Chrome Extension Store [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/btc-hop/glkncpihhcnafncilnphhchplmplklnp).
